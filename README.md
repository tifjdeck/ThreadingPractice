## Compilation Instructions
How do we compile your program?
* At the top of Visual Studio, click the start button and it will run the program after a moment of compilation.

## Program Usage
How do we run your program? Does it expect any Inputs?
* The program will give you prompts to insert the number of darts to throw, and then a number of threads to process.

## Notes
Any extra notes, such as:
* What is working?
  * The program works with any assortment of numbers until you get into the billions (of darts).
* What are the limitations of your program?
  * If the number of darts does happen to reach into the billions, then it will start returning negative numbers and pi will be completely wrong.
* What design decisions did you make?
  * I printed the stopwatch details, which is the only things that wasn't required.
* Is there anything you wish to draw our attention to? (cool trick, extra credit, strange logic, problem area, etc)
  * I added the stopwatch and it gives the time correctly.
